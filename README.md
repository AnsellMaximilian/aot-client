# ATTACK ON TITAN DOCUMENTATION

Vue.js application that consumes an API I created using Laravel. This serves as a documentation for the API as well as to showcase what kind of data the API contains.

## The API

The API can be reached with [this URL](https://attackontitanapi.heroku.com).

To actually consume the API, prepend /api to every request to the base URL.
